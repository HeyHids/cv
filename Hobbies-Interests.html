        <li>Magic: The Gathering</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Magic: The Gathering is the largest and most popular trading card game in the world, I begun this journey of collecting and playing Magic in 2022
                and it has been an amazing (but slowly beginning to be expensive) hobby that I picked up. What draws me to Magic is the creative process in crafting
                my decks around specific playstyles and the lore of the world the game is set in.

        <li>Going to the gym</li>
        <ul>
            <li>I love keeping myself active through going to the gym. I work out on Mondays and Fridays, on the days where I am working from home. Two of my favourite exercises
                are the bench press and the squat as they both have high stakes in the form of the weight being either rested on my chest or pushing me down to the ground.
